# Create 10000+ barcodes using python
create multiple of bar codes using python programming.

Hello moai learners In this tutorial, you will learn how to generate more than 10000+ barcodes using python programming. We are using a library called python-barcode which release by  Hugo Osvaldo Barrera under MIT license. A barcode or bar code is a method of representing data in a visual, machine-readable form. Initially, barcodes represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines. These barcodes, now commonly referred to as linear or one-dimensional (1D), can be scanned by special optical scanners, called barcode readers. Later, two-dimensional (2D) variants were developed, using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns, called matrix codes or 2D barcodes, although they do not use bars as such. 2D barcodes can be read or deconstructed using application software on mobile devices with inbuilt cameras, such as smartphones.
